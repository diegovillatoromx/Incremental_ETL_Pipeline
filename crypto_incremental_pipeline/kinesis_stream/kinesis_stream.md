# AWS CDK Kinesis Data Stream Example
 
## Overview

This repository contains code developed using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to provision a Kinesis data stream within the AWS infrastructure. The following explanation provides a detailed breakdown of the code's components and functionality:

### 1. Importing Necessary Modules and Classes

The code imports essential modules and classes from the AWS CDK and other libraries:

- `Stack` and `Construct` are classes from the AWS CDK, instrumental in the definition and management of AWS resources.
- `aws_kinesis` is a module within the AWS CDK, specifically tailored to Kinesis data streams.
- `Duration` is a class from the AWS CDK utilized for specifying time durations.

### 2. Defining Constants

The code introduces a constant variable named `INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME`. Its value is retrieved using the `config` module from the `decouple` library. The `config` module is responsible for reading configuration values, which may originate from configuration files or environment variables.

### 3. Defining the `KinesisStreamStack` Class

Within the code, a class named `KinesisStreamStack` is defined. This class extends the `Stack` class from the AWS CDK and serves as a representation of an AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) stack for managing AWS resources.

### 4. `__init__` Method Explanation

Inside the `__init__` method of the `KinesisStreamStack` class:

- The constructor of the superclass (`Stack`) is invoked to initialize the stack.
- An instance of `kinesis.Stream` is instantiated, representing a Kinesis data stream.
- Several arguments are passed to the `Stream` constructor:
  - `self`: The current instance of the Stack.
  - `"IntradayKinesisStream"`: A logical identifier used for the Kinesis data stream within the AWS CDK stack.
  - `stream_name=INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME`: The name of the Kinesis data stream, derived from the `INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME` constant.
  - `shard_count=1`: The specified number of shards to create for the stream. In this instance, a single shard is created.
  - `retention_period=Duration.hours(24)`: The duration for which data records are retained within the stream. It is set to 24 hours using the `Duration` class.
