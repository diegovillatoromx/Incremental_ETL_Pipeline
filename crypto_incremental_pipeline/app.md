# AWS CDK Cryptocurrency Incremental Pipeline

## Overview

This Python script harnesses the power of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to define and deploy multiple AWS stacks, each serving as a critical component of a cryptocurrency incremental pipeline. The script starts by importing essential modules and classes, including `os` for accessing environment variables and `aws_cdk` for CDK framework interaction. The script also imports the `Tags` class from `aws_cdk` to enable tagging of the CDK app.

### AWS CDK Environment

The script begins by defining an AWS CDK environment named `env_USA`, which specifies the AWS account ID and region to be used. An instance of the `App` class is then created to represent the CDK app.

### Stacks for Cryptocurrency Pipeline Components

Multiple instances of various stack classes are created within the CDK app, encompassing the following components:

- **KinesisStreamStack**: A stack responsible for managing a Kinesis stream.
- **DataProducerStack**: A stack responsible for deploying a data producer.
- **DataConsumerStack**: A stack responsible for deploying a data consumer.
- **S3BucketStack**: A stack responsible for the creation of an Amazon S3 bucket.

Each stack is associated with a unique name and is configured to use the `env_USA` environment.

### Tags for Organizational Metadata

To enhance organization and resource identification, tags are assigned to the CDK app using the `Tags.of(app)` syntax. These tags include key-value pairs that specify metadata such as the project owner and project name.

### Deployment Using CloudFormation

Finally, the `app.synth()` method is invoked to synthesize the CDK app. This operation generates an AWS CloudFormation template that faithfully represents the defined stacks and their associated resources. The resulting CloudFormation template can then be deployed, facilitating the provisioning of the required infrastructure on AWS.

In summary, this code simplifies the creation and deployment of multiple AWS stacks through the AWS CDK, enabling the establishment of a cryptocurrency incremental pipeline. The CDK's power streamlines the definition and deployment of essential infrastructure resources, while the tagging feature enhances resource organization and management.
